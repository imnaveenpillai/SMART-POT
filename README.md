The SMART POT is an innovative automated plant care system designed to simplify and optimize the process of nurturing plants. The system is equipped with advanced sensors that continuously monitor soil moisture levels and environmental conditions, ensuring that plants receive the precise care they need to thrive.

Key Features:

Soil Moisture Monitoring: The SMART POT uses a soil moisture sensor to detect the moisture content in the soil. This data is crucial for determining when the plant needs watering, preventing both overwatering and underwatering, which are common issues in plant care.

Automated Watering System: Integrated with a small water pump, the system automatically waters the plants when the soil moisture levels drop below a certain threshold. This ensures that the plants are consistently hydrated without the need for manual intervention.

Soil Loosening: A mini fan is included in the system to aerate the soil, preventing it from becoming compacted over time. Proper soil aeration is essential for root health and allows water and nutrients to penetrate the soil more effectively.

Disease Detection: The SMART POT features a camera that continuously monitors the plant for signs of disease. Using image processing techniques powered by OpenCV, the system can detect early symptoms of plant diseases, allowing for timely intervention.

Control and Communication: The system is controlled by a Raspberry Pi, which processes data from the sensors and camera. It communicates with an ESP32 microcontroller to execute actions like watering and soil loosening. The Raspberry Pi and ESP32 communicate serially, ensuring seamless coordination between different components.

Lighting Management: An LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) is incorporated to monitor ambient light levels. When natural daylight is insufficient, the system can provide artificial lighting to ensure that the plants receive adequate light for photosynthesis.

Real-Time Data and App Integration: All the data collected by the sensors and the camera is displayed in real-time through an integrated app. This app allows users to monitor their plants remotely, adjust settings, and receive alerts if any issues are detected.

Overall Functionality:
The SMART POT is designed to automate and optimize the entire plant care process, reducing the effort required by the user while ensuring that plants receive the best possible care. Whether for home gardening enthusiasts or commercial growers, the SMART POT represents a significant advancement in plant care technology, combining automation, real-time monitoring, and smart intervention to promote healthy plant growth.
